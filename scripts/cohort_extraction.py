"""
This script extracts a cohort of critically ill trauma patients from the MIMIC-III v1.4 dataset, 
  applying stringent criteria including age range, admission duration, and mechanical ventilation days, 
  as detailed in Section 3.1 "Cohort Extraction: Critically Ill Trauma Patients" of our paper. 
  The refined cohort, tailored for studying early sepsis onset prediction, comprises 1,570 admissions.

This script is a cleaned-up version of the original notebook located at
    `notebooks/cohort_extraction.ipynb`
While this file focuses on the implementation of functions, the notebook contains more detailed information, including how the functions return and display their results. 
For a deeper understanding and additional context, please refer to the original notebook.

**Notes**:
This script assumes that you have access to MIMIC-III on Google BigQuery. 
If you are unsure about your access or need to apply for it, please visit the `notebooks/MIMIC-III access page` for instructions.

    Select trauma patients according to E-codes of ICD9_CODE.

    Parameters:
    - project_path_obj: An object containing paths to project-related files.
    - project_id: The Google BigQuery project ID for querying the MIMIC-III dataset.

    Returns:
    - DataFrame: A DataFrame containing patients' ICD9 diagnoses filtered by trauma E-codes.

    Notes:
    - This function reads a list of qualified traumatic injury E-codes from an Excel file located
      at 'supplementary/qualified_traumatic_ICD9_Ecodes.xlsx'.
    - The E-codes are reformatted to match the format used in the MIMIC-III dataset.
    - Queries the MIMIC-III clinical database to select all ICD diagnoses where ICD9_CODE is not NULL.
    - Filters the diagnoses to include only those starting with 'E' and matching the qualified trauma E-codes.
